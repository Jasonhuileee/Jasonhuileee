**ANNEX A - JOB SHEET**
You are an Associate AI Engineer with a design studio named "ImagiTech Creations." Your director is exploring a novel Computer Vision product to showcase at a creative arts exhibition, "ArtTech Showcase," scheduled to take place in 12 months. ArtTech Showcase is an annual event that attracts C-Suite Executives and features conferences conducted by international speakers in the design industry.

The design studio will be developing this product internally. However, they will source their training data from another studio known as "Data Scape Studios." The studio plans to bring on board 2 Data Engineers ($35 / hour), 1 AI Engineer ($28 / hour), and 1 Data Scientist ($42 / hour).

The new hires are expected to have varying levels of the following skills:
- Computer Vision
- Machine Learning
- Software Development
- Embedded Systems
- Ethics and Privacy

The finished product should have the following features:
- **People Recognition Algorithm**: The product should feature a cutting-edge recognition algorithm capable of accurately identifying both anime and real people in real-time. This algorithm should exhibit precision in detecting characters and individuals amidst diverse lighting conditions, various facial expressions, and instances of occlusion. The product should be integrated with a robust people recognition algorithm and a high-resolution camera, ensuring the capture of clear images for both anime characters and real people.
- **Real-Time Recognition Capability**: The product should demonstrate the ability to recognise both anime and real people in real-time, enabling swift identification for various applications. This real-time recognition should occur seamlessly without any noticeable delays. The product must incorporate a robust processor, adept at handling real-time image processing and analysis for both anime and real people. Additionally, an optimised software algorithm should leverage the processing power of the hardware, ensuring efficient real-time recognition of faces.
- **Movement Tracking**: Following the identification of an anime character or a real person, the product should possess the capability to track their movement seamlessly within the camera's field of view. This tracking functionality should enable continuous updates for users, facilitating the monitoring of animated characters or individuals of interest. To achieve this, the product should integrate a motorised pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera designed to track and follow animated characters or real people as they move across the camera's field of view. Ideally, the system should incorporate an intelligent tracking algorithm, leveraging the PTZ camera to accurately follow and track the movement of anime characters or real individuals.
- **Notification System**: The product should possess the capability to initiate a notification when an anime character or a real person of interest is identified. This notification system should offer customisation options, enabling law enforcement officers to prioritise alerts based on the severity of the situation. The product must incorporate a speaker system capable of delivering audio notifications to on-duty personnel. Additionally, a customisable alerting algorithm should be integrated to trigger real-time audio notifications whenever an anime character or an individual of interest is detected.

The product should be optimised and achieve an accuracy and F1 Score of at least 80%. During the development, the product will undergo hardware, software, integration, and user acceptance testing under the witness of an independent body.

To realise this, your project manager has tasked you to develop a Proof-of-Concept (POC) prototype of a computer vision model called "CharacterScan". The POC prototype should be able to fulfil the following requirements:
1. Able to load images from a local path for face detection;
2. Able to predict if there is a face of a real person in each image;
3. Able to draw a bounding box around the correctly predicted face; and
4. Able to save each predicted image (with bounding box) to a local path for verification.

Your project manager expects you to develop the POC with an accuracy and an F1 Score reaching a minimum of 80%. The POC should be compiled as an executable software or saved in a data format that could be opened in their respective supported software.
