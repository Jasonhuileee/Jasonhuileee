### Confusion Matrix

| Predicted Condition | Total Population | Predicted Positive (PP) | Predicted Negative (PN) |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Conditional Positive (P) | True Positive (TP) | False Negative (FN) | 25 |
| Conditional Negative (N) | False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN) | 25 |

- **Accuracy**: \((TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)\)
- **F1 Score**: \(2 \times \frac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall}\)
